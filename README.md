# Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-Regressor

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the implementation and comparison of Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor on a dataset. It serves as an educational project for understanding regression techniques using tree-based algorithms.

## Project Overview
In this notebook, we explore:
Decision Tree Regressor: A simple yet powerful algorithm that splits the data into branches to predict continuous target variables.
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
The project walks through data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Key Features
Data exploration and visualization
Model training using scikit-learn's DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor
Performance evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score
Comparison between individual decision tree and random forest models

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook

## Libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
